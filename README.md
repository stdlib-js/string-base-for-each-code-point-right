    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

To use in Observable,

```javascript
forEachCodePointRight = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-base-for-each-code-point-right@umd/browser.js' )
```

To vendor stdlib functionality and avoid installing dependency trees for Node.js, you can use the UMD server build:

```javascript
var forEachCodePointRight = require( 'path/to/vendor/umd/string-base-for-each-code-point-right/index.js' )
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-base-for-each-code-point-right@umd/browser.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    window.forEachCodePointRight;
})();
</script>
```

#### forEachCodePointRight( str, clbk\[, thisArg ] )

Invokes a function for each Unicode code point in a string, iterating from right to left.

```javascript
function log( value, index ) {
    console.log( '%d: %s', index, value );
}

forEachCodePointRight( 'Beep!', log );
/* =>
    4: !
    3: p
    2: e
    1: e
    0: B
*/
```

The invoked function is provided three arguments:

-   **value**: Unicode code point.
-   **index**: starting Unicode code point index.
-   **str**: input string.

To set the function execution context, provide a `thisArg`.

```javascript
function clbk() {
    this.count += 1;
}

var str = 'üëâüèø';

var ctx = {
    'count': 0
};

forEachCodePointRight( str, clbk, ctx );

var cnt = ctx.count;
// returns 2
```
